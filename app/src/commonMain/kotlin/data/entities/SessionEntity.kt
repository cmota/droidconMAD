And if you put them side by side you can see a lot of similarities between both what will ease switching between one to the other if you have to develop for both platforms.\r\n\r\nBut what I told that you could just develop in Kotlin and run it seamlessly on all devices?\r\n\r\nHere comes Kotlin Multiplatform!",
